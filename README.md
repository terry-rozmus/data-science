# data-science
This was the final assignment for my data science course I took this year.
It is study that attempts to make connections between tectonic features around the world and mineing activity.
It has been broken into five parts from its original three, but notebooks still have a large file size.
I hope you are able to be patient while opening them!

The parts are these:
